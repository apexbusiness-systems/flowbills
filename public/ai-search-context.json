  "frequently_asked_questions": [
    {
      "question": "What makes FlowBills different from generic AP automation tools?",
      "answer": "FlowBills is purpose-built for Canadian oil and gas operations. We understand AFEs, field tickets, joint venture billing, working interest calculations, and provincial regulatory requirements. Our OCR is trained on energy sector documents and our duplicate detection accounts for the complexity of petroleum industry invoicing."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does FlowBills handle field tickets with handwritten entries?",
      "answer": "Our advanced OCR engine is specifically trained on handwritten field tickets common in oil and gas operations. We achieve 99.5% accuracy extracting handwritten amounts, dates, equipment hours, and service descriptions. The system flags low-confidence extractions for human review."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can FlowBills integrate with our SAP system?",
      "answer": "Yes, FlowBills has native integration with SAP including bi-directional data sync. We pull vendor master data, purchase orders, and AFE information from SAP, then push back approved invoice data for payment processing. Integration typically takes 2-4 weeks depending on SAP configuration."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does duplicate detection work across different AFEs?",
      "answer": "Our fuzzy matching algorithm analyzes multiple dimensions: vendor name (accounting for variations), invoice date (±7 days), amount (±5%), invoice number, PO number, and AFE code. It catches duplicates even when the same work is incorrectly billed to different AFEs or with slight amount variations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is FlowBills compliant with Alberta PIPA and federal PIPEDA?",
      "answer": "Yes, FlowBills is fully compliant with both provincial (Alberta PIPA, BC PIPA) and federal (PIPEDA) privacy legislation. We implement privacy-by-design principles, maintain audit logs, support data subject access requests, and store all data in Canadian data centers."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the typical ROI timeline for oil and gas companies?",
      "answer": "Most Canadian oil and gas companies achieve ROI in 3-6 months. Key savings come from: 80% reduction in manual processing labor, elimination of duplicate payments (typically 2-3% of AP spend), faster close cycles, reduced audit costs, and improved early payment discount capture."
