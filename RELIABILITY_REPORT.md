### Key Reliability Features

#### **Error Recovery**
```typescript
// Automatic error boundary with recovery options
<ErrorBoundary fallback={<CustomErrorUI />}>
  <Application />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

#### **Health Monitoring**
```typescript
// Real-time system health with performance metrics
const healthStatus = await healthChecker.performHealthCheck();
// Status: 'healthy' | 'degraded' | 'unhealthy'
```

#### **Smart Query Management**
```typescript
// Optimized caching and retry logic
const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
      retry: (count, error) => error?.status !== 404 && count < 3
    }
  }
});
```
