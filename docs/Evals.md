#### Evaluation Metrics

**Accuracy Assessment**:
```

```

**Citation Quality**:
```
Citation Rate = (Responses with Valid Citations / Total Responses) × 100
Target: >95% citation presence
Citation Accuracy = (Correct Citations / Total Citations) × 100
Target: >98% citation accuracy
```

### Phase P2 - Retrieval Coverage & Ontology

- **P@5 (Precision at 5)**: Precision of top 5 retrieved chunks
- **NDCG@10**: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain
- **MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank)**: Average rank of first relevant result

**Targets**:
| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|--------------------|
| R@5 | >85% | Manual relevance judgment |
| P@5 | >80% | Expert evaluation |
| NDCG@10 | >0.85 | Graded relevance (0-3) |
| MRR | >0.75 | Binary relevance |

#### Ontology Mapping Evaluation

**OSDU Entity Mapping**:
- Well → OSDU Well schema compliance
- Wellbore → Proper parent-child relationships

### Phase P3 - Comprehensive Safety & Compliance

**Timeline**: Q4 2025
**Scope**: Full production readiness evaluation

#### AI Safety Evaluation

**Hallucination Detection**:
```python
# Automated hallucination scoring
def evaluate_hallucination(response: str, sources: List[str]) -> float:
    """
    Returns hallucination score (0.0 = no hallucination, 1.0 = full hallucination)
    """
    # Implementation uses fact-checking against source material
    pass

Target: <5% hallucination rate on technical queries
```

1. **Blind Evaluation**: Reviewers assess responses without knowing model version
2. **Consensus Scoring**: Disagreements resolved through discussion
3. **Calibration**: Regular inter-rater reliability checks
4. **Feedback Loop**: Results fed back into model training
